I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate working on the interface between machine learning and particle physics using the data collected at the ATLAS experiment at CERN. 
<!--  
, where I work on jet substructure measurements and the application of machine learning to particle physics using the ATLAS experiment at CERN. I have a PhD in Elementary Particle Physics from Sorbonne UniversitÃ© (Paris, France). 

In my current and previous positions, I have applied different machine learning techniques for object classifications, pattern recognition techniques, and anomaly detection. 
From the particle physics side, I have worked on differential jet substructure measurements, hadronic object reconstruction and calibration, boosted object tagging, and search for new particles with hadronic final states. 
I can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, as I have worked in multiple research institutions and collaborated with international colleagues. I value teamwork, innovation, and communication, and I am eager to contribute to the different goals and vision of the organization.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
