I have a PhD in Elementary Particle Physics from Sorbonne Université (Paris, France).</p> <p>In my current and previous positions, I have applied different machine learning techniques for object classifications, pattern recognition techniques, and anomaly detection. From the particle physics side, I have worked on differential jet substructure measurements, hadronic object reconstruction and calibration, boosted object tagging, and search for new particles with hadronic final states. I can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, as I have worked in multiple research institutions and collaborated with international colleagues. I value teamwork, innovation, and communication, and I am eager to contribute to the different goals and vision of the organization.</p> <p>Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself.
