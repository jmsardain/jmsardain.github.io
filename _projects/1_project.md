Exploring the world of agents was definitely new and exciting to me, coming from a purely fundamental physics background. 
It's fun to read about agents, but it's even more fun to know how they work and how to actually build them. 

After going through some units, one is required to create their own agent using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/papers/2311.12983">GAIA benchmark</a>.
